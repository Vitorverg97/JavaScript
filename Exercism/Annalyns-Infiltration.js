// ‚òùüèΩ The line above enables type checking for this file. Various IDEs interpret

// exercise, and can completely ignore this comment block and directive.

// üëãüèΩ Hi again!
//
// A quick reminder about exercise stubs:
//
// üí° You're allowed to completely clear any stub before you get started. Often
// we recommend using the stub, because they are already set-up correctly to
// work with the tests, which you can find in ./annalyns-infiltration.spec.js.
//
// üí° You don't need to write JSDoc comment blocks yourself; it is not expected
// in idiomatic JavaScript, but some companies and style-guides do enforce them.
//
// Now help Annalyn free her best friend!
